<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Because Enough is Enough Already.</h3>

<p>We've all seen them - the clickbait headlines that websites like Buzzfeed, ViralNova and UpWorthy use to drive traffic, especially through social networks. Even Huffington Post has jumped on the bandwagon of endless recycled listicles and bombastic titles. </p>

<p>Downworthy replaces hyberbolic headlines from bombastic viral websites with a slightly more realistic version. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Literally" becomes "Figuratively"</li>
<li>"Will Blow Your Mind" becomes "Might Perhaps Mildly Entertain You For a Moment"</li>
<li>"One Weird Trick" becomes "One Piece of Completely Anecdotal Horseshit" </li>
<li>"Go Viral" becomes "Be Overused So Much That You'll Silently Pray for the Sweet Release of Death to Make it Stop"</li>
<li>"Can't Even Handle" becomes "Can Totally Handle Without Any Significant Issue"</li>
<li>"Incredible" becomes "Painfully Ordinary"</li>
<li>"You Won't Believe" becomes "In All Likelihood, You'll Believe"</li>
<li>... and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>These articles are, in general, not nearly as bad as their titles - but the titles have become SO overblown, they're meaningless and annoying. But people still click, so the trend continues. Consider this me doing my part to stop the insanity. </p>

<h3><a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h3>
<p>Downworthy was created on January 21, 2014, sparked by a funny exchange on Twitter a few weeks prior where I suggested writing a plugin to take the hyperbolic headlines on viral websites to their next logical conclusion. </p>
