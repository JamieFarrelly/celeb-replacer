# Celeb Replacer Chrome Extension

Replaces well known celebrities with different celebrity names on every web page you visit, often leading to entertaining results.

Replaces some well known celebrities such as Kim Jong Un to other celebrities (in this case Kim Kardashian). Can end up being quite funny now and again!
